# 🛡️ DevOps & Security Engineering Journey

> *"From zero to production-ready: A documented path to becoming a DevOps Engineer with security-first practices."*

## 🎯 Mission
Transform from complete beginner to job-ready DevOps/Security Engineer through hands-on, project-based learning. Every project here represents real-world skills employers need.

## 👨‍💻 About
I'm a self-taught DevOps engineer building production-ready skills from the ground up. This repository documents my journey from zero technical knowledge to job-ready professional, with emphasis on security-first infrastructure practices.

**Background:** Complete beginner (started October 2025)  
**Focus Areas:** Linux administration • Automation • Containerization • Security hardening  
**Learning Method:** Project-based, hands-on work using industry-standard open-source tools  
**Current Goal:** Build a portfolio of real-world projects that demonstrate DevOps competency

Every project here represents skills I can apply on day one of a DevOps role.

- **Current Week:** 1 of 32
- **Projects Completed:** 0 / 9
- **Tools Mastered:** 3 (Linux, Git, SSH)
- **Commits This Week:** Starting now!

## 🎓 Learning Principles
1. **Build, don't just read** - Every concept tied to a working project
2. **Document everything** - If it's not documented, it didn't happen
3. **Security-first mindset** - Bake security in from day one, not as an afterthought
4. **Real-world scenarios** - Simulate actual DevOps responsibilities and incidents
5. **Open source only** - All tools are free and production-grade
